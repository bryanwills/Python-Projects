A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA.

 

0 Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to
love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but
as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a
gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer-excellent for drawing the veil from men's
motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more
disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that
woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

Thad seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete
happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his
own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society
with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and
alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy
of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense
faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries
which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of
his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular
tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night~it was on the twentieth of March, 1888~I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now
retumed to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door,
which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in
Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass
twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon
his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and
manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot
upon the scent of some new problem, I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been
in part my own.
Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test -- Printable

the awarding of athletic scholarships, at 34 C.F.R. § 106.37(c). Further clarification of the Title IX regulatory requirements is provided by
the Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Interpretation, issued December 11, 1979 (44 Fed. Reg. 71413 et seq. (1979)).4

The Title IX regulation provides that if an institution sponsors an athletic program it must provide equal athletic opportunities for members
of both sexes. Among other factors, the regulation requires that an institution must effectively accommodate the athletic interests and
abilities of students of both sexes to the extent necessary to provide equal athletic opportunity.

The 1979 Policy Interpretation provides that as part of this determination OCR will apply the following three-part test to assess whether an
institution is providing nondiscriminatory participation opportunities for individuals of both sexes:

1. Whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially
proportionate to their respective enrollments; or

2. Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the institution can
show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and
abilities of the members of that sex; or

3. Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot show a history and
continuing practice of program expansion, as described above, whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the
members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.

44 Fed. Reg. at 71418.

Thus, the three-part test furnishes an institution with three individual avenues to choose from when determining how it will provide
individuals of each sex with nondiscriminatory opportunities to participate in intercollegiate athletics. If an institution has met any part of
the three-part test, OCR will determine that the institution is meeting this requirement.

It is important to note that under the Policy Interpretation the requirement to provide nondiscriminatory participation opportunities is only
one of many factors that OCR examines to determine if an institution is in compliance with the athletics provision of Title IX. OCR also
considers the quality of competition offered to members of both sexes in order to determine whether an institution effectively
accommodates the interests and abilities of its students.

In addition, when an "overall determination of compliance" is made by OCR, 44 Fed. Reg. 71417, 71418, OCR examines the institution's
program as a whole. Thus OCR considers the effective accommodation of interests and abilities in conjunction with equivalence in the
availability, quality and kinds of other athletic benefits and opportunities provided male and female athletes to determine whether an
institution provides equal athletic opportunity as required by Title IX. These other benefits include coaching, equipment, practice and
competitive facilities, recruitment, scheduling of games, and publicity, among others. An institution's failure to provide nondiscriminatory
participation opportunities usually amounts to a denial of equal athletic opportunity because these opportunities provide access to all other
athletic benefits, treatment, and services.

This Clarification provides specific factors that guide an analysis of each part of the three-part test. In addition, it provides examples to
demonstrate, in concrete terms, how these factors will be considered. These examples are intended to be illustrative, and the conclusions
drawn in each example are based solely on the facts included in the example.

THREE-PART TEST -- Part One: Are Participation Opportunities Substantially Proportionate to Enrollment?

Under part one of the three-part test (part one), where an institution provides intercollegiate level athletic participation opportunities for
male and female students in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective full-time undergraduate enrollments, OCR will find that
the institution is providing nondiscriminatory participation opportunities for individuals of both sexes.

OCR's analysis begins with a determination of the number of participation opportunities afforded to male and female athletes in the
intercollegiate athletic program. The Policy Interpretation defines participants as those athletes:

a. Who are receiving the institutionally-sponsored support normally provided to athletes competing at the institution involved, e.g.,
coaching, equipment, medical and training room services, on a regular basis during a sport's season; and

b. Who are participating in organized practice sessions and other team meetings and activities on a regular basis during a sport's
season; and

c. Who are listed on the eligibility or squad lists maintained for each sport, or

d. Who, because of injury, cannot meet a, b, or c above but continue to receive financial aid on the basis of athletic ability.

44 Fed. Reg. at 71415.

OCR uses this definition of participant to determine the number of participation opportunities provided by an institution for purposes of the
three-part test.

Under this definition, OCR considers a sport's season to commence on the date of a team's first intercollegiate competitive event and to
conclude on the date of the team's final intercollegiate competitive event. As a general rule, all athletes who are listed on a team's squad
or eligibility list and are on the team as of the team's first competitive event are counted as participants by OCR. In determining the
number of participation opportunities for the purposes of the interests and abilities analysis, an athlete who participates in more than one
sport will be counted as a participant in each sport in which he or she participates.

In determining participation opportunities, OCR includes, among others, those athletes who do not receive scholarships (e.g., walk-ons),
those athletes who compete on teams sponsored by the institution even though the team may be required to raise some or all of its
operating funds, and those athletes who practice but may not compete. OCR's investigations reveal that these athletes receive numerous
benefits and services, such as training and practice time, coaching, tutoring services, locker room facilities, and equipment, as well as
important non-tangible benefits derived from being a member of an intercollegiate athletic team. Because these are significant benefits,
and because receipt of these benefits does not depend on their cost to the institution or whether the athlete competes, it is necessary to
count all athletes who receive such benefits when determining the number of athletic opportunities provided to men and women.
